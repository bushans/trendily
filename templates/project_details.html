        <p class="lead">
          I often find myself looking at other women's outfits and thinking to
          myself, I wonder where she got that {article of clothing} from! This
          is particularly true when scrolling through social media, where people
          tend to post their best-looking photos. To solve this problem, I
          created a women's fashion recommender that could take a photo (say,
          from a social media outlet), analyze it, and recommend similar items
          that a user might like to try. This recommender system eases the
          debate I have all too often: awkwardly ask her where she buys her
          clothes, or spend the next 2 months searching stores and the internet
          for a similar piece.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          I've created a recommendation system that, based on an image selected
          by the user, can recommend similar options available on Rent the
          Runway for the user to try. To create this recommender, I trained 5
          Convolutional Neural Networks to perform specific tasks, such as
          classifying the type of clothing (pants/shirt/jacket) or classifying
          clothing attributes (stripes, floral, lace, etc)). After training the
          CNNs, I concatenated the trained embeddings from each model to create
          a complex "description" of each photo. Recommendations are based on
          cosine similarity of the inventory embeddings to the embedding of the
          user-input photo
