# Trendily: Fashion Recommendations

A standalone HTTP web server that can recommend similar fashion outfits, based on the the [Rent the Runway](https://www.renttherunway.com/) inventory.

Uses multiple neural networks (with a ResNet50 backbone) behind the scenes to classify inputs by {category, texture, fabric, parts, shape}. The resulting embeddings are then used to query a pre-built nearest neighbors index for similar outputs.

## Installation

Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the web server, simply execute flask with the main recommender app:

```sh
FLASK_APP=recommender_app flask run
```

The main predictor can also be used independently of Flask, by calling `get_recs`:

```python
from predict import Predict

fashion = Predict()
recs = fashion.get_recs(img_path)
```
